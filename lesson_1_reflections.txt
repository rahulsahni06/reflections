How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff tells me exactly where the changes has occured so I can easily point
    out the changes and find bugs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    With history of a file I can see at what point I have implemented a certain
    feature, so I can easily undo it if that feature is causing some problem in
    future builds

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
    I can commit whenever there is a logical change in the code, so each feature
    will be separated by commits and I can easily remove a particular feature
    when there is a bug due to that feature

    cons:
    I constantly have to commit new features manually, I might forget to commit
    sometime.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for code, and in this files are mostly interrelated to it is better to 
    commit all those files together whereas VCS like Docs are not specific to just
    codes and they can be used to store any type of information like images, videos
    which are independent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists out all the commits and git diff can be used to see the
    differences between two git commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With VCS we can easily revert back to a previous bug-free state

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for my android app
