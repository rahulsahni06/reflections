What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a new folder named .git is created in the working directory, and the
	directory is converted to git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	
	all the files added to the staging area are tracked by git whereas the left 
	over files are not tracked unless they are also added to staging area. With
	file tracking we can easily identify which files have changed

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	As soon as a logical change has ocuured add it to staging area and then commit it.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	They would be helpful if we are try some new features which might take more 
	than one logical change to implement. We could keep this feature separate from
	the main branch so that it does not this experimental feature does not affect
	the main branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
