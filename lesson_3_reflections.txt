When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I have to create a backup of my work or when I have to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I might not be ready to integrate my local changes with the remote. Updating my local
	repo with the remote might cause some conflict while I am working on a new feature,
	then I have to divert from my priority and fix the conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

	Clone is a copy of a repository which can be at remote or a local also, fork is similar
	to clone only difference is that the in fork, cloned repository is saved at github.
	Branch is a collection of commits, and helps to organize and manage the commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can work offline, we can also compare it with the lastest state of remote on github
	and compare the changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

	To collaborate with others I have to send files to others, keeping track of changes or
	reverting back to a previous state would be difficult. Only easy think I can think of 
	is that I don't have to learn git

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
	
	Whenever I am implementing a new feature or fixing a bug while I am collaborating
	with others I would use a new branch. It helps to implement the above things without
	worrying about breaking the current working version and it also helps in reviewing the
	code of other collaborators before merging it into the master.
